### What were Kofi and Dolapo's experiences applying to boarding school?

In this episode, we discuss our experiences applying to boarding school!

Before applying, we spent most of our days caught up in middle school shenanigans: hanging out with friends, thinking about our crushes, trying to fit in. We discuss how boarding school prompted us to begin thinking more seriously about our futures, about how we could set ourselves up for success but also how much we appreciated fun and how we wanted even funner experiences free from our parents.

Next, we discuss the elitism we saw in boarding school, and we reconcile that with the goals our immigrant parents had for us.

Finally, we discuss how boarding school drastically altered our relationships with those we loved most: our families. We share how we, as 13-year-olds, thought about leaving the guidance of our parents, and going to the strange, new place that was boarding school.
